# GigaControl connector pinout

Three 2x10, 1.00 mm pitch straight female sockets on the control card: Hanxia HX PM1.0-2x10P ZC, LCSC C22465702. Matching proposed right-angle male headers on the power board: HX PZ1.0-2x10P WZ, C22465711.

F.Cu view: J1, J2, J3 left to right; odd row at Y=88.1, even row at Y=87.1. Pad-1 X positions: 138.1, 150.1, 162.1 mm. Three sockets span 34.4 mm of nominal housing length. Phase contacts and connector positions are preserved. Three reserved interface contacts have been reclaimed for GND; active peripheral signals retain their numeric sequence while shifting pins.

J3 GND contacts: pins 1, 10, and 20 (left, middle, right). Peripheral remapping starts at J2 pin 17; the table below is authoritative.

Phase 3: columns 4-8; phase 2: 9-13; phase 1: 14-18. All 41 active non-ground signals retained, with 19 ground contacts. RESERVED1/2/3 no longer cross the connector; their MCU-side circuitry is unchanged.

## Mechanical notes

- Local socket footprint follows the Hanxia drawing: body 10.4 x 2.5 mm, height 2 mm, 1 x 1 mm pin grid, 0.50 mm finished holes. Pads are 0.8 mm; courtyard includes body tolerance plus assembly clearance. No 3D model is assigned.
- Numbering is the project logical odd/even convention; the unkeyed manufacturer drawing does not define pin 1. Power-board mating placement must map contacts physically, not copy the control footprint rotation blindly.
- Upright card inserts horizontally with right-angle male pins on the horizontal power board. Allow withdrawal clearance and provide a guide/support; do not rely on the three connectors for vibration support.
- Header drawing has 0.30 mm square contacts and 2.00 mm nominal horizontal exposed tips; the 1.8 mm dimension is vertical tail projection. Socket drawing does not specify a recommended mating-pin insertion range; verify engagement with samples before manufacture.
- Connector fanout remains unfinished; moving pads does not reroute existing traces. No raw battery voltage crosses the interface.
